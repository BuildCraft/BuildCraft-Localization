BuildCraft-Localization
=======================

Localizations for BuildCraft

### en_US

The en_US localization is not part of this repository but instead part of the main code. Do not add a en_US.lang file.

### Encoding

Files must be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM. Pull requests, submissions or contributions not encoded in UTF-8 without BOM will have to be rejected or reverted.

### License

The BuildCraft license applies.

### Issues

Errors in translation that you are somehow unable to make a pull request for, can be filed here. Missing localization support or code issues that affect localization should be filed in the main BuildCraft repository.

### Gate Localization

If your language requires a specific sequence for the Gates, you can replace the "%s" with "%1$s" for the material and "%2$s" for the type of gate (AND and OR)
